# Sentry plugin for @vue/cli 3.0.

## Install
First you need to install @vue/cli globally ([follow the instructions here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)).

Then create a project and add the Sentry plugin:

```
vue create your-app
cd your-app
vue add sentry
```

You'll be asked some questions regarding how sentry/raven is configured in your project. After that, you're good to go.
